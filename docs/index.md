### Virtual Workshops

The Risk-Based Alerting hands-on workshop is designed to familiarize participants with the RBA methodology used in Splunk Enterprise Security. Our journey will begin with walking through the process of creating Risk Rules and Risk Data Models. From the creation of these Risk Data Models we will cover how these can lead to Risk Notables and Alerting. Users will better understand how to build and engineer their own risk rules and risk notables in Splunk Enterprise Security and tune these to provide more immediate insights to their analysts.

#### Who Should Attend

The workshop is designed for people on a Security Operations team responsible for content creation, usually the Detection Engineering team.

#### Reminder

This is a 4-hour, hands-on event. You will need your laptop and internet access and will need to join a Webex meeting to participate in this workshop.

#### Next session to be announced
